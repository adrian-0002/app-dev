# spiderman 3

## Part of the Spider-Man Trilogy: "Spider-Man 3" is the third and final film in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, which began in 2002. The trilogy starred Tobey Maguire as the titular superhero.

### Superhero Action: If you love superhero movies, particularly with intense action sequences, "Spider-Man 3" has some spectacular action scenes involving Spider-Man's battles with multiple villains.

## Multiple Villains: The film features three main villains: Venom (Topher Grace), Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), and New Goblin (James Franco). This was a departure from the first two films, which usually focused on one primary antagonist.

### Character Development: This movie delves deeper into Peter Parker's character than the previous films, showing his vulnerabilities and flaws. It’s an exploration of ego, revenge, and the consequences of unchecked power.

## Emo Peter Parker: One of the more meme-worthy aspects of the movie is Peter Parker's transformation under the influence of the symbiote. His "dark side" is expressed through a more rebellious and "emo" look, a subplot that both intrigued and puzzled audiences.



# 13 reasons why

## The show is based on Jay Asher’s 2007 novel "13 Reasons Why", which centers on the aftermath of a teenage girl's suicide and the tapes she leaves behind detailing the reasons for her actions.

### Expanding Narrative: While the first season closely follows the events in the novel, subsequent seasons dive into new plotlines, exploring themes like the aftermath of suicide, school violence, and legal struggles related to Hannah's death.

## Controversial Themes: The series covers heavy, real-world topics such as mental health, suicide, sexual assault, bullying, and self-harm. The series sparked debates about its handling of sensitive material, especially its portrayal of the suicide scene in season 1.

## Trigger Warnings: In response to criticism regarding the graphic content, the series added trigger warnings before episodes and included mental health resources for viewers affected by the show's subject matter.
